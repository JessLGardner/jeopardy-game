# Jeopardy Game

## Project Description

A quiz game where the user chooses a point value from the gameboard. The user then gets a question with multiple answers to choose. User is notified when the chosen answer is right or wrong and the score is updated. When a certain score is reached, the user is notified of winning or losing the game.

The goal of this project is to create a cohesive, interactive application using my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.
